#Aarush recently learned probability in his school. He was finding the probability of different events and he wondered whether he can develop a program to do the same thing
#or not. To help Aarush create a program in python where user can enter number of favorable outcomes and total number of possible outcomes and then program will print the
#probability of that event on the screen. ‚óè Note: ‚óè Print the probability of the event only up to 2 decimal places. ( For this use round() function ) ‚óè Sample run ‚óè >>Enter
#the number of favorable outcomes: 1 ‚óè >>Enter the total number of possible outcomes: 2 ‚óè >>Probability: 0.5

favourable_outcomes=int(input("Enter the number of favourable coutcomes:"))
total_number_of_outcomes=int(input("Enter the total number of outcomes:"))
probability=round(favourable_outcomes/total_number_of_outcomes,2)
